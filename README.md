## Problem statement 
  Analyze music trends and predict song popularity based on its musical attributes (Danceability%, Valence%, Energy%, Acousticness%, Instrumentalness%, Liveliness%, and Speechiness%)
 
## Models Used
 - Linear regression model 
 - Decision tree model 
 - K-means clustering model 

## Music Trends Analysis and Prediction

## Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing music trends and predicting song popularity based on various musical attributes using data from the Spotify Songs Dataset. We leverage machine learning techniques, particularly K-means clustering, linear regression, logistic regression and decision trees, to gain insights into the relationship between song attributes and popularity. 

## Approach:
- **Data Collection: Dataset Used**: “Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023” by Nidula Elgiriyewithana
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis. We removed irrelevant columns, selected songs after 2010 and converted streams to a numeric column.
- **Exploratory Analysis & Visualisation**: We began by exploring the Spotify Songs Dataset to understand its structure and characteristics, visualizing it into the file.
- **Machine Learning**: Tried different approaches to find the optimal model, with the most successful one being K-means clustering. 
- **Analysis and Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's accuracy and analyzed the distribution of songs across different popularity labels.

## Conclusion :
K-means clustering revealed distinct clusters representing various levels of song popularity, from highly popular to specialized energetic. The logistic regression model achieved high accuracy in predicting song popularity labels based on danceability, valence, and energy attributes.

## What did we learn from this project? 
mpl_toolkits.mplot3d module in Matplotlib specifically designed for creating 3D plots within Matplotlib
other visualization libraries (plotly)
ML model (K-mean clustering)
